# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2022-07-01

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

# Telling the story of a website involves _highlighting_ its **inception, purpose, evolution, and impact**. Here's how you could go about it:

**88Introduction**: Begin by introducing the website and its primary purpose or mission. This sets the stage for the story you're about to tell.

**2Inception**: Share the backstory of how the website came into existence. This could include the inspiration behind its creation, the individuals or team involved, and any challenges or obstacles they faced in bringing it to life.

**1Purpose**: Clearly articulate the purpose or goals of the website. What problem or need does it address? How does it aim to make a difference in its users' lives or in the broader context of its industry or community?

**12313Evolution**: Describe how the website has evolved over time. This could include updates to its design, functionality, or content, as well as any major milestones or achievements it has reached along the way.
